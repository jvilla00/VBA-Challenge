# VBA-Challenge
-----------------------------------------------
The VBA Repository contains all the starter files for the vba module 2 challenge. There are three png screenshots of the final outcome after the vba file is run on the three worksheets in the workbook provided. The screenshots demonstrate the four new columns created, the final values of each ticker, and the yearly change column with conditional formatting. The vba file contains the code for the excel file that calculates and prints out a summary table of all of the tickers, their respective yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume.
